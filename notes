### Notes:

#### Sept 9 2015:
	Check if the gains from cross validation is significant.
	$sd = \sqrt((0.75*(1-0.75))/7000)
	Binomial Standard Deviation
	This is good for the report to calculate if gains in algorithm were significant

	TODO:
	Graphs for varying size of train/test set
	Why my accuracy is lower
	Relationship between popularity vs naive bayes
