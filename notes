### Notes:

#### Sept 9 2015:
	Check if the gains from cross validation is significant.
	$sd = \sqrt((0.75*(1-0.75))/7000)
	Binomial Standard Deviation
	This is good for the report to calculate if gains in algorithm were significant

	TODO:
	Graphs for varying size of train/test set
	Why my accuracy is lower
	Relationship between popularity vs naive bayes


### Sept 23 2015

	TODO:
	Vary size of training set and test set
	Generate graph of alpha variying
	Generate graph of epsilon varying
	Generate graph of hashtags to predict varying
	Generate graph of hit range varying
	Install caffee
	Logistic Regression using caffe



### Sept 30 2015

	TODO:
	start writing report
	install caffe
	better graphs
	have graph for vary size of training and test set
	predict out of 500 hashtags, not 56
	50 examples where predicted correct, 50 examples where prediction is incorrect
		for each example compute the top log probabilities. E.g. hashtag is basketball, lebron has high P(hashtag|word)
